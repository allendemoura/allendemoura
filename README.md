### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm an OSCP certified InfoSec researcher. A budding developer turned ethical hacker by the fascinating world of cybersecurity. I love questions - asking too many, and answering them all. The world of Information Security has given me an outlet for my relentlessly inquisitive mind, and an ever-evolving landscape that satisfies my constant drive to learn more. I spend my time taking things apart, and I'm inspired by building things to break things to make the world a more secure place.
