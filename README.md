### Greet ðŸ‘‹
I'm an OSCP certified InfoSec researcher - Developer turned ethical hacker by the fascinating realm of cybersecurity. Building things to break things to make the world a more secure place. I love questions - asking too many, and answering them all. The world of Information Security has given me the perfect outlet for my relentlessly inquisitive mind, and an ever-evolving landscape that satisfies my constant drive to learn more.
